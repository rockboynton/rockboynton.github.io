                </div>
                <p>
                    I am a Computer Engineering Student at Milwaukee
                    School of Engineering currently studying User Experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When I am not studying, doing laboratory/homework
                    assignments, I enjoy working on personal projects with my
                    Arduino, STM32, and new Raspberry Pi Zero W development
                    boards.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>  
                    Outside of tech, I am also a member of the MSOE varsity hockey team
                    as a goaltender where I have earned NCHA All-Academic team
                    honors for 2 years in a row. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am also an avid outdoors fan and like to go
                    hiking/backpacking when I have some time off.

                    <p>MSOE Hockey Home Opener</p>
                    <h1>Task</h1>
                    <p>My task was to individually design a poster in 2 weeks following good UX design principles such as C.R.A.P (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity). I also explored the use of typography, layout,and color.</p>
                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>My primary goals were to employ what I have learned in my course to create a visually appealing poster that was engaging and informative. I wanted to make it easy for someone to know what it is in a split second or passing glance, guide them in, and when they examined it, quickly try to promote the event and increase attendance.</p>
                    <h1>Design Decisions</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I used a block type font that really announced what the event was and stood out visually in the 3rd dimension.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>I chose our school&rsquo;s athletic logo as the centerpiece because it is visually attractive and powerful.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>I placed action shots of two players flanking either side of the poster to visually show what sport the event is, as well as increase the sense of action.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>I used a nice backdrop shot of the MSOE Kern Center that accomplished 3 tasks simultaneously</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It provides the location of the event</li>
                            <li>It provides the approximate time of the event</li>
                            <li>It increases the sense of action with the streaking car lights</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>I blurred the background slightly to have the text stand out.</li>
                        <li>I highlighted a bonus incentive if the person looking at the poster was pondering whether they should go.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Results</h1>
                    <p>I believe the final result shows a good use of the design principles learned in my UX course.</p>

                    <h1>Portfolio Wireframes</h1>
                    <h2>
                        Summary
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        My task was to create rough wireframes of a my
                        portfolio website. The final deliverable was 2 hand
                        drawn sketches and 2 computer mockups. I had about a
                        week to complete this project. It was challenging to
                        decide how I wanted the website to look, but once I did
                        it flowed smoothly. This was an individual project.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Analysis
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I think I did a good job keeping a
                        simple format and not making it too complex or
                        cluttered. I gained new skills on determining spacing
                        and overall layout of web pages. I learned how to use
                        the website Balsamiq to transfer my ideas to a computer
                        in an easily iterable way. I improved on my skills of
                        quickly finding information through documentation on
                        Balsamiq's website and chat forums. This project helped
                        me narrow in on what I wanted my portfolio to look like
                        and I will definitely use this technique in the future
                        when I want to build another website.

                When building this portfolio, I was going for a clean and modern
                user interface. I wanted a very simple landing page with just
                my name and title. I also wanted easy access navigation. I
                decided to do this using a hamburger menu element to allow for
                large and easily accessible font. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Next, I wanted a short about section to give users a sense of
                who I am as a person as well as provide a professional photo of
                myself to put a face to the name.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I added a short sevices section just to show what I'm capable
                of, then wanted a portfolio of recent projects. I tried to make
                it show my thought processes aas much as possible and not focus
                too much on the end result, because that is what users are most
                likely looking for here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I added a timeline of my work to show where I have
                professionally worked previously. And finally a contact form to
                easily get in touch.

            <p>
                I am really glad I took this course to learn about User
                Experience research and design to see the user side of
                development. Before this class, I had been focusing on building
                my technical skills and wanted to learn more about how to design
                products/applications with the users in mind make very
                accessible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this course, I began learning about the psychology behind
                a user's perception. I learned popular design patterns and
                heuristics for making good design decisions as well as what to avoid.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I learned visual design principles, like C.R.A.P, to gain
                insight on what actually makes a user interface appealing and
                interesting, as well as practice in applying those using fun,
                interactive games. I also studied building good information
                architecture to have a good hierarchy of information which was
                especially helpful when designing my portfolio.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the research side, I conducted user interviews for a
                design project, making sure to have a clear goal and focused
                questions to gain the insight I needed to develop a good
                finished product. This was my first experience doing something
                like this and it really helped me learn to observe carefully to
                pick up on some subtle things to improve in my design. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also conducted "Make-it-work" usability research on my
                portfolio where I walked through my website with a potential
                user asking them to complete tasks that represented what I had
                researched to be the most common things a user would want to do.
                This was a great experience because it showed me that everybody
                has different intuition and what's easy for someone might not be
                easy for another.
